I've entered into something approaching a routine at RC, though it may get interrupted or changed. Over the weekend and today, I continued with my MIT course and particularly enjoyed getting back into math. I've been taking detours into topics I've been interested in for a while that are at least somewhat relevant to working with data, like Bayesian inference. And I've also been venturing into calculu just a little to try to get my head around the discussion of integrals and derivatives in these data science courses. 

I'm re-assessing my strategy of just focusing on courses and think I need to swing into "project" mode this week...
