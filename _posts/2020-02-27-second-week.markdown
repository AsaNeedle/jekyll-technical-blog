title:  "Week Two Recap"
---

It's Thursday, and my second week is almost over. I started with a great deal of zeal. I was throwing myself into MIT Open Course Ware and am now in the process of stepping back and taking stock of what I've accomplished. 

Most of my focus has been on working through MIT Open CourseWare's [Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/index.htm) I'm about half-way through the course. I've watched 7 of 15 lectures and finished 2 of 5 problems sets, and am working on the third. Since the course is in Python, I'm learning Python along the way (or at least getting more comfortable with it). 

Other than that I went to the Algorithms meet-ups on Tuesday and Thursday, and we worked on [Huffman Encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) and a tree algorithm from a book called [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/). 

Also absorbing so much technical know-how, so many tips and pointers, through osmosis. I feel very lucky to be able to be here. 

That's all for now,
Asa
