Today was a day focused on my dinky [little trello-style app](https://asaneedle.github.io/trello-style-app/).

I read this article on [authentication in react](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/authentication-in-react-applications) using a higher-level component to manage what people see based on whether they are logged in or not. This something I want to learn how to do! 

Then I was trying out how to deploy straight to [GitHub Pages from React](https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f) and got it to work by adding an option in my package.json to create a branch just for deploying to GitHub Pages. 

All in all, a day with a lot of time looking at actual code, which was good.

Love,
Asa
