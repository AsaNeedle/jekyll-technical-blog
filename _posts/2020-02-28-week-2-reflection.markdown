This is a more thorough review of my last week culled from my notes. All in all, a very full week!

Monday: 
I spent a lot of time scheming on my plan for my time at RC and researching MIT OpenCourseWare. Finally settled on working on the course Intro to Computational Thinking and Data Science, which I had already done the first few lectures of. 

Tue:
I went to algorithms study group, which was great. I also found myself working with another RCer on a problem from a book called Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. It's a lot like a book I'm more familiar with, called How to Design Programs. Both use a language called Scheme to introduce programming concepts.
I then got distracted because someone mentioned the [Nand game](http://nandgame.com/) There was a presentation session at RC, with four presentations on tech topics, such as an app to classify bird sounds (which was at the same time a form of site-specific sound art). I started reading some philosophy of technology in the evening, and was reflecting on how to relate my training in social and political theory with this intense study of technology I'm currently engaged in.

Wed:
Did more MIT coursework.
Got set up with [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) for inputting programming/math things I don't want to forget! Ipent some time reading computer generated poetry and searching for project inspiration. I met Sonali Sridhar, one of the founders of RC, and she gave me some helpful pointers on how best to use my time here. I also spent a lot of time setting up this blog, which uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I think it was helpful, because I was familiarizing myself with [git](https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/) in the process, but I was spending maaaybe too much time on it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Thu:
I was pushing through this coursework, and a lot of it is on probability, which I find fascinating: Monte Carlo simulations, sampling, and graphing with a programming language called Python. I went to algorithms class, and learned about an interesting tree problem from a book called Cracking the Coding Interview. The funny thing about algorithms is that while they are important to understand, they receive disproportionate attention because interviewers often use algorithm problems as a test of a developer's level of ability. I also a made a great connection with someone working on developing the app Signal so that it can provide better secure group texting for community organizers.

Fri: 
I had a bit of a stalled day, but was reading and working on a lot of different stuff in a desultory way. I paired with someone working on a tool to assist in learning Chinese. On Fridays there are technical talks, which were also a great chance to see what everyone else was working on.  

For this upcoming week, I want to finish off this MIT course for good (so it's not hanging over my head) and then dive into another course, this time on [algorithms](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/) and also practice the JavaScript library React by starting a more substantial project.
