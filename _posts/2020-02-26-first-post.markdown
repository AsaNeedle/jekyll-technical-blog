Hi! Welcome to my first official post for my time at the Recurse Center. For those that don't know, the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) is a "writer's retreat for programmers" inspired by the independent learning philosophy of unschooling (or deschooling). 

I'm here for three months and now well into my second week. So much has happened but I'm determined to recap it and then keep a log here of my adventures going forward.

Stay tuned and lots of love,
Asa
