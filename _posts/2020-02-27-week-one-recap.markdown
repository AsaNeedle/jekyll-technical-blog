title:  "Week One Recap"
---

I'm going to start by recapping my first week here. The first day was a complete blur. I was just immersed in meeting everyone and adjusting to the space, both the physical space and the mental/cultural space of being surrounded by programmers and programming things constantly.

I felt like I was just playing catch-up, trying to keep up with all the big ideas being thrown around. There was a great deal of energy and momentum around Haskell, Lambda calculus, and functional programming. I was somewhat familiar with the latter two of these concepts just from working through a book called "How to Design Programs" which discusses them, but I also felt in over my head. I treated this week as a "gathering" week. That meant my goal was just to collect as much stuff as possible, saying "yes" to everything and going for breadth over depth. 

For more concrete projects, I worked on a small to-do list app in the style of trello to get back into the swing of coding. 
Things I learned doing that project:
* How to listen for drag and drop events, so that you can let users drag things around on a website. 
* About some of the advantages/disadvantages of React (a JavaScript library which is often used when making a complicated, interactive website instead of just using plaing JavaScript without libraries).
* About the pros/cons of using things like to Create React App, which lets you get set up with an application using React quickly, but also makes a bunch of decision for you and it's not totally clear how to change them. 
* How to use a cloud platform called Heroku to get my website out and on the internet for free. 
* And many other things I'm sure I'm forgetting

There were also so many workshops/tutorials and no less than three separate mini-talk events where RCers presented on their technical or non-technical interests. There were too many interesting ones to recap, but absorbing them ambiently is affecting how I think about technology, creativity, and my time here. 

Much love,
Asa
