I've been thinking a lot about motivation, and what it means to be at Recurse right now. On the one hand, there are stressors and uncertainties I couldn't have imagined a month ago. On the other, I'm finding a kind of focus and consistency, but I wonder about its origins. Why is suddenly easier to adhere to structures I set for myself? 

I led a workshop on procrastination at RC, and then had another session this week with another RCer where we both worked on filling out government forms as a kind of procrastinative solidarity. 

I've been diving into the self-help/productivity/journaling world with mostly positive results. Just inclining myself to think pragmatically by surrounding myself with material on productivity has been helpful. Some books I've been picking up include "Getting Things Done" by David Allen, "Deep Work" by Cal Newport, and, in a different vein, Jack Kornfield's "After the Ecstasy, the Laundry". 

On a more technical note, last week I completed a small project in Python. It was my first time using Flask, a light-weight web framework for Python. You can see it here: https://winphilosophyinfluencepeople.herokuapp.com/
